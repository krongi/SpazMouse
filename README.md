Base code to masquerade as a bluetooth mouse. Connect to it the same way you would a legit bluetooth mouse. Then let it do it's thing. You can either disconnect from the device using the menu or just power down the device. 
The device can be plugged in anywhere within bluetooth range. This can help on keeping suspicion down. A device that doesn't need to be physically plugged into your machine can go un-noticed much longer. Do whatever with the code
I don't care. Not exactly complex. A spider monkey with brain damage could've written this. Just stashing everything here now.
